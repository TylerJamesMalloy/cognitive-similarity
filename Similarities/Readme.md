# Similarities Folder (./Similarities)
This folder contains code for the 4 files required to replicate the 6 similarity metrics discussed in the paper. Additionally there is a similarity.py file containing the superclass of all similarity metrics. The human subjective similarity, which all similarity metrics are compared against, is in the human.py file, results shown in figure 1. The cosine, weighted cosine, and pruned cosine files are all contained in the cosine.py file, results shown in figures 2-4. The semantic similarity measure is contained in the semantic.py file, results shown in figure 5. Our proposed IBIS similarity metric is in the ibis.py file, results shown in figure 6. All metrics are also displayed in Figure 7.
